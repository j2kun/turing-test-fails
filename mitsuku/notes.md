# Notes

[Source](http://www.square-bear.co.uk/mitsuku/turing/)

The program had a 5 minute time limit on a chat, and prevented you from typing
while the AI was composing its message. Moreover, the program revealed the text
of the AI slowly, as if to pretend it was typing very slowly. It produced
occasional spelling errors, and even simulated typing, deleting, and correcting
those errors. This prevents you from having a conversation longer than maybe 15
messages.

# Rules violated

- Time length (restricted to 5 minutes)
- Giving additional interaction besides the text of the message (faking typing,
typos).
